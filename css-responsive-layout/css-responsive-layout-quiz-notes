## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a **breakpoint** in responsive Web design?
a breakpoint refers to a specific screen size or viewport width at which the layout and styling of a webpage is adjusted

- What is the advantage of using a percentage (_e.g._ `50%`) width instead of a fixed (_e.g._ `px`) width for a "column" class in a responsive layout?
 it allows the columns to adjust and scale proportionally based on the available screen width or container size.

- If you introduce CSS rules for a smaller `min-width` _after_ the styles for a larger `min-width` in your style sheet, the CSS rules for the **smaller** `min-width` will "win". Why is that?
because of the way CSS works with specificity and the cascade.
